# Final Project
Use this `REAMDE.md` file to describe your final project (as detailed on Canvas).

## Project Setup
> Successfully created git repository and added all group members to the repo.
>
> We are using well formatted git markdown throughout this document.

## Domain of Interest
**1. Why are you interested in this field/domain?**
> Considering that India has the second largest population in the world, and since all the team members of this group were born and raised in India, we  wanted to learn more about the demographics of the Indian population. Along with this, there is a vibrant distribution of the population in the country based on various geographical, political, religious and socio-economic factors that affect the patterns of distribution and the type of people that live in the different regions of the country. This makes us more interested in doing the population study of this country which is affected by a combination of different factors which we were sure will be answered in the National Census reports conducted by the Government of India.

**2. Examples of other data driven projects related to this domain**

*Project 1*
> - [Project 1 Link](https://www.kaggle.com/omkar25/census)
> - Project Description: This project is done based on the Indian Census of 2001. This project is very detailed with respect to drawing inferences about the different female, male population in different Indian states. At the same time, it also talks about the income, schooling, and other identifiers about the population of the country which will help us to analyze the Indian census data in a holistic manner.

[Project 2 Link](https://www.kaggle.com/rameshsinghds1986/analyzing-indian-census-2011)
> - Project Description: This project is about analyzing of the Indian census 2011 which is more recent than the census 2001. The special thing about the project is that they use a good combination of numerical and visual ways of analysis to draw inferences about the project. The numerical ways of analysis include mean, median, quartiles and visual ways of bar and line graphs to analyze the data in a more comprehensible manner. Overall, this project has more advance tools of data visualization and analysis.

*Project 3*
> - [Project 3 Link](https://censusindia.gov.in/2011census/dchb/0700_PART_B_DCHB_NCT%20OF%20DELHI.pdf)
> - Project Description: This project is very different from the other two projects mentioned above. This is complete government resource describing the regional data distribution using the geo-mapping technique of data analysis. The project also provides with additional textual information on the backgrounds of the demographics of the data collected which makes the report even more easy and informative for the reader to understand. This additional tools are surely something to be inspired from for the final project.

**3. What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain?**

> - Differences between male and females characteristics throughout different states of India in terms of literacy, employment.
>
> - This question can be answered by finding the interstate and the intra state comparison of female:male literacy and employment comparison. This can be done using the bar graphs. We can also analyze this through the ratio of the literacy and employment ratio of females:men across different states in India.
