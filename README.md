## Domain of Interest
**1. Why are you interested in this field/domain?**
> Considering that India has the second largest population in the world, and since all the team members of this group were born and raised in India, we  wanted to learn more about the demographics of the Indian population. Along with this, there is a vibrant distribution of the population in the country based on various geographical, political, religious and socio-economic factors that affect the patterns of distribution and the type of people that live in the different regions of the country. This makes us more interested in doing the population study of this country which is affected by a combination of different factors which we were sure will be answered in the National Census reports conducted by the Government of India.

We can also analyze this through the ratio of the literacy and employment ratio of females:men across different states in India.
